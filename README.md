## Getting Started

A simple movie catalog app built with React and NodeJS back end.

Viewable demo here: https://gracious-booth-ec7685.netlify.com/

## Client (/src)

### `npm install` 

Install dependencies <br />

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>

## Server (/api)

### `npm install` 

Install dependencies <br />

### `npm start`

Runs the server in development mode.<br>

## Notes

Because this app could become a full fledged IMDB site, I've limited the definition of done to this: basic crud operation on a movie catalog that utilizes a flat json file as the "database." 

You should be able to view, add, modify, and delete from the list of movies.
